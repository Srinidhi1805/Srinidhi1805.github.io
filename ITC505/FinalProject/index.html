            My development process for this Lights Out game involved several steps and creative choices. Initially, I
            focused on building the core functionality, including generating a random board, toggling squares, and
            checking win conditions. I chose to use a grid layout for the board and implemented click event listeners on
            each square. To achieve a dynamic experience, the starting configuration is generated using backtracking,
            ensuring a solvable puzzle each time.
            <br><br>
            One challenge I faced was ensuring the generated boards were actually solvable. I overcame this by employing
            a backtracking algorithm within the initialization function, simulating random clicks until a solution was
            found. This process ensured every generated configuration had a path to victory. Additionally, I implemented
            a win condition that displays the number of moves it took to solve the puzzle, adding a layer of challenge
            and engagement.
            <br><br>
            Overall, developing this game was a rewarding experience that challenged me to think creatively and apply
            problem-solving skills. Through the process, I gained valuable insights into implementing algorithms like
            backtracking and designing user interfaces that are both visually appealing and functional.
